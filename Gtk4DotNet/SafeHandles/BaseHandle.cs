// When working with unmanaged resources, you should consider:

// Using an existing SafeHandle if possible
// If not possible, subclass SafeHandle to create one that meets your needs. This class should not do anything more than managing unmanaged resources. It should be sealed.
// If that's not possible, create your class which implements IDisposable and a finalizer
// The class should be sealed
// If sealing the class is not possible, add a method protected void Dispose(bool disposing), so subclasses can implements the dispose pattern correctly.
